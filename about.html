      <h2>Why ClearAxis Exists</h2>

      <p>
        Many organizations collect large amounts of data, yet struggle to use it
        effectively. Spreadsheets grow complex, reporting becomes time-consuming,
        and insights are often buried.
      </p>

      <p>
        ClearAxis Analytics was created to solve this problem by simplifying how
        data is organized, analyzed, and delivered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work focuses on building clean data foundations and systems that
        support confident, informed decision-making.

        <h3>Clarity First</h3>
        <p>
          Data should inform decisions, not overwhelm them. We design reporting systems that 
          highlight what matters and remove unnecessary noise.

      <h2>Founder Background</h2>

      <p>
        ClearAxis Analytics was founded by a trained biotechnologist with a strong
        foundation in analytical and scientific problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Experience in technical environments highlighted a recurring issue:
        valuable data was often underutilized due to poor structure or inefficient
        workflows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This led to a focused transition into data analysis and automation, where
        scientific rigor could be applied to business systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same principles used in laboratory research — accuracy, validation,
        and reproducibility — now guide every project at ClearAxis.
